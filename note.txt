In blog page you need to render the template and also create an api to get the blog

separate API endpoint for getting blog only and separate endpoint for getting 
its comments by passing the blog id similar to the API used in unsplash 
for getting author's details by passing image id. Or just send the author's 
data which means mentioning author data is must.
